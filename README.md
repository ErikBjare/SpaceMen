### Space background

The entire background exists in `images/space.xcf`, open it in Gimp and export to pngs on a layer-by-layer basis without the black background.
The top layer (#4) should have few, larger stars. The third layer (#3) should have fewer medium-sized stars. The second layer should have small, and a larger amount of stars. The bottom/first layer should have **billions and billions** of stars, small as they are in the far distance.
If anyone comes up with or knows of a formula regarding the size/depth ratio to maximize realism, PLEASE TELL US!
